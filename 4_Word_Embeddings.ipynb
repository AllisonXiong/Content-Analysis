        "# Week 4 - Exploring Semantic Spaces (Word Embeddings)\n",
        "This week, we build on last week's topic modeling techniques by taking a text corpus we have developed, specifying an underlying number of dimensions, and training a model with a neural network auto-encoder (one of Google's word2vec  algorithms) that best describes corpus words in their local linguistic contexts, and exploring their locations in the resulting space to learn about the discursive culture that produced them.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is our third document representation we have learned: First, we used word counts. Second, we used LDA topic models built around term coocurrence in the same document (i.e., a \"bag of words\"). Third, documents here are represented as densely indexed locations in dimensions, so that distances between those documents (and words) contain more information, though they require the full vector of dimension loadings (rather than just a few selected topic loadings) to describe. We will explore these spaces to understand complex, semantic relationships between words, index documents with descriptive words, identify the likelihood that a given document would have been produced by a given vector model, and explore how semantic categories can help us understand the cultures that produced them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that most modern natural language processing (NLP) research, at least in computer science, uses word embeddings. This is the foundation of most state-of-the-art models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also note that the code in this Notebook can take many minutes or even hours to run. This is the case for most NLP research these days, and it's a good opportunity to start thinking about how to manage high-compute workloads, such as running code on small samples to test it, loading datafiles in [chunks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25962187), or [multiprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessing)."

        "\n",
        "Since the original word2vec paper, there have followed a slew of word embedding related methods which innovate and build on them in many ways. One popular extension is FastText ([Bojanowski et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606)), which uses sub-words to generate its vectors. Using subwords means that it is powerful in dealing with unknown words and sparse languages that otherwise have a rich morphological structure. These sub-words are incorporated into the previously skipgram and CBOW methods. For example, if the word is “which”, it is represented as the word itself along with a bag of constituent n-grams. If n=3, the representation looks like <wh, whi, hic, ich, ch>, and we learn a representation for each of these constituents, with the word “which” taking on the average value of these constituents. \n",

        "FastText can be used either via Gensim or the official package, and primarily has two functions - word representations, and text classification (Joulin et al. 2017). See below for code using the FastText package for playing with word representations, taken from their word representations tutorial (https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/unsupervised-tutorial.html).\n"

        "Recently computer scientists have developed methods to cluster word embeddings, which can be viewed as a topic model, an embedding-based version of conventional topic models that use the document-term matrix (e.g., LDA). One method is Discourse Atoms, first described by Princeton NLP researchers ([Arora et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03764)). This uses k-SVD, a generalization of the k-means clustering algorithm to identify topic-like vectors in the n-dimensional word embedding space. Below is code adapted from the first social science paper using Discourse Atoms, [Arseniev-Koehler et al. 2021](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nkyaq/). It takes as input _gensim_ word vectors.\n",

It runs faster, produces more detailed topics, and in general makes use of more information (i.e., word order within a document) than do conventional topic models. Note there are at least 4 other papers with methods for word embedding clusters:\n",
